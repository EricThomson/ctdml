# Code the Dream ML Workspace
A workspace to develop hands-on, accessible machine learning materials for [Code the Dream](https://codethedream.org/). This space is to experiment with lesson plans, identify the most important skills, and create learning paths for Python 200. Student facing-material will be hosted separately at Code the Dream. 

## Plan
The following is just a lite annotated list. For more detailed discussion, please [see the docs](https://ctdml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)!

- **Week 1: Hello ML**: Overview of the general ML landscape, and hands-on work with regression. 
- **Week 2: Classification with scikit-learn**: Build classification workflows in scikit-learn. Install PyTorch. 
- **Week 3: Machine vision with PyTorch**: Our first introduction to neural networks and deep learning. Run inference with PyTorch.
- **Week 4: Transfer learning and object detection**: Fine-tune pre-trained networks. Also, learn the basics of object detection.
